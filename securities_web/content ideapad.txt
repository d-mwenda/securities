What is AAS?
For the African investor or investor interested in African securities.
We are always work in progress - not cliche. We build as we go! It might not be here today but will be tomorrow. Wanted something you didn't find? The contact form is also a suggestion box. Let us know. How nice, right?

Why AAS?
You can find todays data easily but not last months. While this data is available freely an publicly, most exchanges and providers don't avail it freely - the irony. How about we look for all historical data and going forward, collect the data daily.

How will it be funded?
In order this keep this site up, running and free, we will need funding. We think Ads will be able to keep us more than afloat - we could be wrong but does it hurt to try? We promise to keep the ads non-obstructive and reasonable in number per page. Use the contact page to give us your thoughts.
We love feedback. To make it easy for you to let us know your thoughts, we have a very easy form.
